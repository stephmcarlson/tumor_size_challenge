# tumor_size_challenge

In this activity, a dataset comparing 9 drug treatments vs. a placebo was analyzed to determine the effectiveness of the drugs.
Further analysis was done to compare Capomulin to 3 of their competitors.

Data was summarized by drug and select data was visualized into bar charts, pie charts, line graphs, box plots and scatter plots with a regression to help aid the analysis.

Overall findings are below:

- Capomulin and Ramicane were the most effective treatment methods with both drugs ending the study with an average tumor size of approximately 40 vs. a starting tumor size of 45. Interestingly, these drugs had the most data points leading to the possibility that these drugs had the largest impact due to having a longer treatment regimen indicated by the larger amount of data points.

- For the drugs chosen for further analysis, Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin, only one data point was considered an outlier providing confidence in the data set. In addition to this, the sex of the mouse was close to equally distributed with 51% male and 49% female leading to a low probability of sex impacting the data set.

- When analyzing data for a single mouse as a representation of the Capomulin treatment, there is a strong decline in tumor size over the course of the time points highlighting the effectiveness of the treatment.

- Finally, the last data point for tumor size in mice treated with Capomulin, the data point at the end of the treatment regimen, has a strong correlation coeffient of .84 indicating that the variability in the tumor size can be strongly explained by the weight of the mouse.
